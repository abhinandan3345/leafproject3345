Automatic Identification Of Ayurvedic Leaves Using Deep Learning   


##  Introduction
In  this  project,  identification  of  medicinal  plant  leaves  was  carried  out  using  the  Convolutional  Neural Network method. CNN is  one of the algorithms from the branch of Machine Learning that is based  on  Artificial  Neural  Networks  (ANN)  or  its  development,  namely  Deep  Learning  which  is  a  development  of  the  Multilayer Perceptron  (MPL)  to process  two-dimensional  data.
## Acknowledgements

 - This project “Automatic Identification Of Ayurvedic Leaves And Their Benefits Using Deep Learning” was a great learning experience for us and we are submitting this work to Advanced Computing Training School (CDAC ACTS). 

    We all are very glad to mention the name of Mr.Abhay Mane , Project Engineer, (C-DAC)) for his valuable guidance to work on this project. His guidance and support helped us to overcome various obstacles and intricacies during the course of project work.
## Objectives Of  The Project
- Detecting the Ayurvedic plant leaves  in CNN 
- Display of scientific name and their benefits in UI.
